  Third version of the scaling adapter.
  Starts with pool size 1 and the enters Scaling state.
  Scaling state: scaling with increasing step size (capped at 4)
  When no significant performance improvement is gained it settles at last pool size.
  When in Settled state enter Exploring state from time to time (both down/up).
  If Exploring step gains performance, enter Scaling mode again.
  If exploring down and no perf drop, keep exploring down.
  If settled and thread pool workqueue size close to 0, unconditionally
  explore down with chance of 50%.
